Here are our style guides for writing a Ruby on Rails application.

Style matters.

Refer to [rails-style-guide](https://github.com/lumoslabs/rails-style-guide) and [ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/lumoslabs/ruby-style-guide) for Rails and Ruby style, respectively. Their counterparts in this repo should be considered obsolete, but you are welcome to make pull requests in the new repos for anything you want to preserve.
